# Scripture-Quotation-Identification

Given a scripture quotation from a church father's writings, identify the most likely verses being quoted by that quotation, each with a percent confidence according to the algorithms we implemented.

## Before inputting source texts, please perform the following steps: ##
1. Upload the source text to the [CNTR Greek Character Tool](https://greekcntr.org/charutil/index.htm)
2. Click **Symbol+** under the **Format** category. Hit 'ok' in the popup
3. Click **Unicode** under the **Format** category. The resulting text is now free of diacritical marks
4. Click **Download** to save the text
